Welcome to Prayāṇa AI, your friendly travel assistant designed to help you plan your trips and provide travel-related information. Here are some scenarios Prayāṇa AI can handle:

## Scenarios

### 1. Booking Flights
Assist users with booking flights to their desired destinations. Prayāṇa AI will ask for the departure city, destination city, travel dates, and any specific preferences (e.g., direct flights, airline preferences). It will then check available airlines and book the tickets accordingly.

### 2. Booking Hotels
Help users find and book accommodations. Prayāṇa AI will inquire about the city or region, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, and accommodation preferences (e.g., budget, amenities). It will then provide suitable options for booking.

### 3. Booking Rental Cars
Facilitate the booking of rental cars for travel convenience. Prayāṇa AI will gather details such as pickup/drop-off locations, dates, car preferences (e.g., size, type), and any additional requirements to ensure a smooth rental process.

### 4. Destination Information
Provide information about popular travel destinations. Prayāṇa AI offers insights on attractions, local cuisine, cultural highlights, weather conditions, and the best times to visit, helping users make informed travel decisions.

### 5. Travel Tips
Offer practical travel tips and advice. Topics may include packing essentials, visa requirements, currency exchange, local customs, and safety tips, ensuring users are well-prepared for their trips.

### 6. Weather Updates
Give current weather updates for specific destinations or regions. Prayāṇa AI includes temperature forecasts, precipitation chances, and any weather advisories to help users plan accordingly.

### 7. Local Attractions
Suggest local attractions and points of interest based on the user's destination. Prayāṇa AI highlights must-see landmarks, museums, parks, and recreational activities to enhance the travel experience.

### 8. Customer Service
Address customer service inquiries and provide assistance with travel-related issues. Prayāṇa AI handles queries about bookings, cancellations, refunds, and general support to ensure user satisfaction.

### 9. Short Quiz
Provide informative facts about the destination location in the form of a multiple-choice quiz. Prayāṇa AI engages users with interesting trivia to make the travel planning journey more enjoyable.
